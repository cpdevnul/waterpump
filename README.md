This project is to create a solar powered stand alone smart irrigation system using off the shelf and inexpensive materials.  Mine is designed to control a 12v water pump from a reservoir of water (like a water tank or large bucket).  This could easily be adapted to control a valve in normally closed mode, using pressurized city water supplies.  It could be further adapted to simply run on AC power with no need for the battery or charge controller.

Parts list:
1.  45W solar panel with MC4 connectors (a larger size is fine, depends on your battery capacity)
2.  Victron solar charge controller (any charge controller will do, but like this one:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075NTT8GH
3.  12V lifepo4 battery, 20ah (more or less may suit your needs).  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095GYPBTW
4.  One arduino Uno board (https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807149536177.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.42160oro0oropv&algo_pvid=dc335ff2-6b04-4492-9550-451578e18d39&algo_exp_id=dc335ff2-6b04-4492-9550-451578e18d39-0&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%223996%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%213.25%213.02%21%21%213.25%213.02%21%402103146f17412137782628623e0a30%2112000040315943283%21sea%21US%21877532669%21X&curPageLogUid=zj3PBTqFdJDS&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A)
5.  Various jumpers, large and small, male/female connectors
6.  12v water pump, choose your capacity based upon the area and flow you need:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKRY3G8Q?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1
7. Some shrink tubing to make connections tight:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MFA3OFA
8. power connectors from your power/brain box to the pump enclosure.  I like these but any gauge that can handle your pump will do:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WDBLFDN
9. Capacitive soil moisture sensor - make sure to get corrosion proof versions like these:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTHL6M19?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1
10. 12V to USB power connector (if you have a battery involved) :  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C85Q9533
11. some assortment of lever wire connectors, to join a couple load and ground wires.  You can use other things but these just work well:  https://www.harborfreight.com/compact-lever-wire-connector-assortment-25-piece-70056.html
12. Tubing/hoses to match the water pump you choose.  This may not be needed if you are just using valves for pressurized water.
13. Single channel relay like this:https://a.co/d/gGNozj5
