This project is to create a solar powered stand alone smart irrigation system using off the shelf and inexpensive materials.  Mine is designed to control a 12v water pump from a reservoir of water (like a water tank or large bucket).  This could easily be adapted to control a valve in normally closed mode, using pressurized city water supplies.  It could be further adapted to simply run on AC power with no need for the battery or charge controller.

Parts list:
1.  45W solar panel with MC4 connectors (a larger size is fine, depends on your battery capacity)
2.  Victron solar charge controller (any charge controller will do, but like this one:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075NTT8GH
3.  12V lifepo4 battery, 20ah (more or less may suit your needs).  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095GYPBTW
4.
